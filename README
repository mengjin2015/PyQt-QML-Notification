PyQt5 Notification

This is a simple windows 10 like notification which is platform independent 

Check out the sample.pyw to know how to use it

Usage:

1. If you just need to post a single message and do not need the message stacking effect, just 'py sample.pyw'
2. If you need the message stacking effect, start the server with 'py server_sample.py' and post messages by 'py client_sample.py [arguments]'

Requirement:
Python 3 is required.

Customization:
If you want to change the appearance of messages without changing their layout, just modify the message.qml.
If you want to further change layout of messages, modify the message.qml and ui_notification_qml.py files.
